# Coffee Machine Implementation Documentation

## Overview
This is a Java-based implementation of a coffee machine simulator that allows users to order different types of coffee, manage resources, and handle transactions. The system is designed with object-oriented principles and follows clean code practices.

## Core Components

### 1. CoffeeMachine Class
The main controller class that manages the coffee machine operations.

**Key Features:**
- Menu management using HashMap for efficient coffee selection
- Resource tracking
- User interaction handling
- Transaction processing

### 2. Coffee Class
Represents different types of coffee drinks available in the machine.

**Features:**
- Builder pattern implementation for flexible coffee creation
- Immutable design to ensure thread safety
- Resource requirements tracking (water, milk, coffee)
- Price information

### 3. Transactions Class
Handles all monetary transactions and resource management for coffee preparation.

**Features:**
- Payment processing with support for different coin denominations
- Change calculation
- Resource availability checking
- Coffee preparation process

### 4. Resources Class
Manages the machine's resources (water, milk, coffee, money).

**Features:**
- Resource level tracking
- Resource consumption monitoring
- Status reporting
- Batch resource updates

## Key Improvements from Original Implementation

1. **Code Organization**
   - Implemented Builder pattern for Coffee class
   - Centralized menu management
   - Improved error handling
   - Added constant definitions for monetary values

2. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Reduced object creation in main loop
   - Simplified resource management
   - Improved memory usage with final fields
   - Better scanner management

3. **User Experience**
   - Enhanced error messages
   - Improved menu display
   - Better formatting of monetary values
   - Clearer resource status display

4. **Maintainability**
   - Added comprehensive documentation
   - Improved method naming
   - Reduced code duplication
   - Better separation of concerns

## Usage Guide

### Starting the Machine
```java
CoffeeMachine coffeeMachine = new CoffeeMachine();
coffeeMachine.start();
```

### Adding New Coffee Types
```java
Coffee newCoffee = new Coffee.CoffeeBuilder()
    .name("Mocha")
    .water(200)
    .milk(100)
    .coffee(24)
    .price(3.50)
    .build();
```

### Checking Resources
```java
resources.displayResources();
```

## Best Practices Implemented

1. **SOLID Principles**
   - Single Responsibility Principle in class design
   - Open/Closed Principle in coffee type additions
   - Interface Segregation in transaction handling

2. **Design Patterns**
   - Builder Pattern for Coffee class
   - Singleton Pattern for resource management
   - Command Pattern for menu operations

3. **Error Handling**
   - Graceful handling of insufficient resources
   - Proper transaction validation
   - User input validation
